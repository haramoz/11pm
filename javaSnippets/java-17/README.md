# Introduction
Here I am going to explore the most useful Design patterns in Java using java 17 and Spring.

## Strategy Design Pattern
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

## Observer Design Pattern
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
